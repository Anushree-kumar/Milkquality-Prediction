# Milkquality-Prediction

### Introduction
The dairy industry plays a crucial role in our daily lives, providing us with a staple source of nutrition in the form of milk and its by-products. However, ensuring consistent milk quality poses a significant challenge for dairy farmers and producers.By embracing milk quality prediction, stakeholders in the dairy industry can proactively manage the production process, mitigate risks, and make informed decisions to ensure optimal milk quality at every stage.

### About the dataset
This dataset is manually collected from observations. It helps us to build machine learning models to predict the quality of milk.
This dataset consists of 7 independent variables ie pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, and Color.
Generally, the Grade or Quality of the milk depends on these parameters. These parameters play a vital role in the predictive analysis of the milk.

### Objective
To leverage the benefits of machine learning in the dairy industry.
